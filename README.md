## Akka HTTP quickstart in Scala

Please see the [quickstart guide](https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-http-quickstart-scala/) for a
walk through the code.

You can use [Giter8][g8] to create your own project from the quickstart. Or, download and extract the zip file(https://example.lightbend.com/v1/download/akka-quickstart-scala?name=akka-quickstart-scala) to a convenient location.

Prerequisites:
- JDK 17
- sbt 1.4.x or higher

Open a console and run the following command to apply this template:
 ```
sbt new akka/akka-http-quickstart-scala.g8
 ```

This template will prompt for the following parameters. Press `Enter` if the default values suit you:
- `name`: Becomes the name of the project.
- `scala_version`: Specifies the Scala version for this project.
- `akka_http_version`: Specifies which version of Akka HTTP should be used for this project. Must be at least 10.6.0.
- `akka_version`: Specifies which version of Akka should be used for this project. Must be at least 2.9.0.
- `organization`: Specifies the organization for this project.

The template comes with the following sources:

* `QuickstartApp.scala` -- contains the main method which bootstraps the application 
* `UserRoutes.scala` -- Akka HTTP `routes` defining exposed endpoints
* `UserRegistry.scala` -- the actor which handles the registration requests
* `JsonFormats.scala` -- converts the JSON data from requests into Scala types and from Scala types into JSON responses

Once inside the project folder use the following command to run the code:
```
sbt run
```
