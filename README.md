## Akka HTTP quickstart in Scala

Please see the [quickstart guide](https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-http-quickstart-scala/) for a
walk through the code.

You can use [Giter8][g8] to create your own project from the quickstart. Alternatively, you can download
a packaged version of this project by clicking "Create a project for me!" on the
[Lightbend Getting Started](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=akka&project=akka-http-quickstart-scala)
page.

Prerequisites:
- JDK 8
- sbt 0.13.13 or higher

Open a console and run the following command to apply this template:
 ```
sbt -Dsbt.version=0.13.15 new akka/akka-http-quickstart-scala.g8
 ```

This template will prompt for the following parameters. Press `Enter` if the default values suit you:
- `name`: Becomes the name of the project.
- `scala_version`: Specifies the Scala version for this project.
- `akka_http_version`: Specifies which version of Akka HTTP should be used for this project.
- `akka_version`: Specifies which version of Akka should be used for this project.
- `organization`: Specifies the organization for this project.

The template comes with the following sources:

* `UserRegistryActor.scala` -- the actor which handles the registration requests.
* `UserRoutes.scala` -- Akka HTTP `routes` defining exposed endpoints.
* `QuickstartServer.scala` -- the main class which combines Akka HTTP `routes` with the actor to run HTTP server.
* `JsonSupport.scala` -- converts the JSON data from requests into Scala types and from Scala types into JSON responses.

Once inside the project folder use the following command to run the code:
```
sbt run
```
